ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.
    Enter RODERIGO and IAGO 
RODERIGO
    Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
IAGO
    'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
    If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
RODERIGO
    Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
IAGO
    Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
    Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
    But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
    Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
    And, in conclusion,
    Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
    'I have already chose my officer.'
    And what was he?
    Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
    A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
    That never set a squadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows
    More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
    Wherein the toged consuls can propose
    As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
    Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
    By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
    He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
    And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
RODERIGO
    By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
IAGO
    Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
    Whether I in any just term am affined
    To love the Moor.
RODERIGO
    I would not follow him then.
IAGO
    O, sir, content you;
    I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
    Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
    That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
    For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
    Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
    And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
    Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
    their coats
    Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
    And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
    In following him, I follow but myself;
    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
    But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
    For when my outward action doth demonstrate
    The native act and figure of my heart
    In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
RODERIGO
    What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
    If he can carry't thus!
IAGO
    Call up her father,
    Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
    Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
    And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
    Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
    Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
    As it may lose some colour.
RODERIGO
    Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
IAGO
    Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire
    Is spied in populous cities.
RODERIGO
    What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
IAGO
    Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
    Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
    Thieves! thieves!
    BRABANTIO appears above, at a window
BRABANTIO
    What is the reason of this terrible summons?
    What is the matter there?
RODERIGO
    Signior, is all your family within?
IAGO
    Are your doors lock'd?
BRABANTIO
    Why, wherefore ask you this?
IAGO
    'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
    your gown;
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
    Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
    Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
    Arise, I say.
BRABANTIO
    What, have you lost your wits?
RODERIGO
    Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
BRABANTIO
    Not I what are you?
RODERIGO
    My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO
    The worser welcome:
    I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
    In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
    To start my quiet.
RODERIGO
    Sir, sir, sir,--
BRABANTIO
    But thou must needs be sure
    My spirit and my place have in them power
    To make this bitter to thee.
RODERIGO
    Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO
    What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
    My house is not a grange.
RODERIGO
    Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pure soul I come to you.
IAGO
    'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
    serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
    do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
    have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
    you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
    coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
BRABANTIO
    What profane wretch art thou?
IAGO
    I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
    and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
BRABANTIO
    Thou art a villain.
IAGO
    You are--a senator.
BRABANTIO
    This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO
    Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
    As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
    At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
    Transported, with no worse nor better guard
    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
    If this be known to you and your allowance,
    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
    But if you know not this, my manners tell me
    We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
    That, from the sense of all civility,
    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
    Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
    I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
    Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
    Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
    If she be in her chamber or your house,
    Let loose on me the justice of the state
    For thus deluding you.
BRABANTIO
    Strike on the tinder, ho!
    Give me a taper! call up all my people!
    This accident is not unlike my dream:
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
    Light, I say! light!
    Exit above
IAGO
    Farewell; for I must leave you:
    It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
    To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
    Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some cheque,
    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
    Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
    Another of his fathom they have none,
    To lead their business: in which regard,
    Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
    Yet, for necessity of present life,
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,
    Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
    And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
    Exit
    Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches
BRABANTIO
    It is too true an evil: gone she is;
    And what's to come of my despised time
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
    With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
    How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
    Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
    Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
RODERIGO
    Truly, I think they are.
BRABANTIO
    O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
    Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
    By what you see them act. Is there not charms
    By which the property of youth and maidhood
    May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
    Of some such thing?
RODERIGO
    Yes, sir, I have indeed.
BRABANTIO
    Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
    Some one way, some another. Do you know
    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
RODERIGO
    I think I can discover him, if you please,
    To get good guard and go along with me.
BRABANTIO
    Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
    I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
    And raise some special officers of night.
    On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. Another street.
    Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches 
IAGO
    Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
    Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
    To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
    Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
    I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
OTHELLO
    'Tis better as it is.
IAGO
    Nay, but he prated,
    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
    Against your honour
    That, with the little godliness I have,
    I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
    Will give him cable.
OTHELLO
    Let him do his spite:
    My services which I have done the signiory
    Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
    Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
    I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
    From men of royal siege, and my demerits
    May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
    As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
    I would not my unhoused free condition
    Put into circumscription and confine
    For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
IAGO
    Those are the raised father and his friends:
    You were best go in.
OTHELLO
    Not I I must be found:
    My parts, my title and my perfect soul
    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
IAGO
    By Janus, I think no.
    Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches
OTHELLO
    The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
    The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
    What is the news?
CASSIO
    The duke does greet you, general,
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
    Even on the instant.
OTHELLO
    What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO
    Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
    It is a business of some heat: the galleys
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
    This very night at one another's heels,
    And many of the consuls, raised and met,
    Are at the duke's already: you have been
    hotly call'd for;
    When, being not at your lodging to be found,
    The senate hath sent about three several guests
    To search you out.
OTHELLO
    'Tis well I am found by you.
    I will but spend a word here in the house,
    And go with you.
    Exit
CASSIO
    Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO
    'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
    If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
CASSIO
    I do not understand.
IAGO
    He's married.
CASSIO
    To who?
    Re-enter OTHELLO
IAGO
    Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO
    Have with you.
CASSIO
    Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO
    It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
    He comes to bad intent.
    Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons
OTHELLO
    Holla! stand there!
RODERIGO
    Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO
    Down with him, thief!
    They draw on both sides
IAGO
    You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO
    Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
    Good signior, you shall more command with years
    Than with your weapons.
BRABANTIO
    O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
    Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
    If she in chains of magic were not bound,
    Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
    So opposite to marriage that she shunned
    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
    Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
    Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
    That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
    Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
    That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
    'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
    For an abuser of the world, a practiser
    Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
    Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
    Subdue him at his peril.
OTHELLO
    Hold your hands,
    Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
    Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
    Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
    To answer this your charge?
BRABANTIO
    To prison, till fit time
    Of law and course of direct session
    Call thee to answer.
OTHELLO
    What if I do obey?
    How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
    Whose messengers are here about my side,
    Upon some present business of the state
    To bring me to him?
First Officer
    'Tis true, most worthy signior;
    The duke's in council and your noble self,
    I am sure, is sent for.
BRABANTIO
    How! the duke in council!
    In this time of the night! Bring him away:
    Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
    Or any of my brothers of the state,
    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
    For if such actions may have passage free,
    Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
    Exeunt
SCENE III. A council-chamber.
    The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending 
DUKE OF VENICE
    There is no composition in these news
    That gives them credit.
First Senator
    Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
DUKE OF VENICE
    And mine, a hundred and forty.
Second Senator
    And mine, two hundred:
    But though they jump not on a just account,--
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,
    'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
    I do not so secure me in the error,
    But the main article I do approve
    In fearful sense.
Sailor
    [Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
First Officer
    A messenger from the galleys.
    Enter a Sailor
DUKE OF VENICE
    Now, what's the business?
Sailor
    The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
    So was I bid report here to the state
    By Signior Angelo.
DUKE OF VENICE
    How say you by this change?
First Senator
    This cannot be,
    By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
    To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
    The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
    And let ourselves again but understand,
    That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
    So may he with more facile question bear it,
    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
    But altogether lacks the abilities
    That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
    We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,
    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
First Officer
    Here is more news.
    Enter a Messenger
Messenger
    The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
    Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
First Senator
    Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
Messenger
    Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
    Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
    Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
    With his free duty recommends you thus,
    And prays you to believe him.
DUKE OF VENICE
    'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
    Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
First Senator
    He's now in Florence.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
First Senator
    Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
    Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers
DUKE OF VENICE
    Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.
    To BRABANTIO
    I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
    We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
BRABANTIO
    So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
    Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
    Take hold on me, for my particular grief
    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
    And it is still itself.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Why, what's the matter?
BRABANTIO
    My daughter! O, my daughter!
DUKE OF VENICE Senator
    Dead?
BRABANTIO
    Ay, to me;
    She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
    For nature so preposterously to err,
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
    Sans witchcraft could not.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
    Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
    And you of her, the bloody book of law
    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
    After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
    Stood in your action.
BRABANTIO
    Humbly I thank your grace.
    Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
    Your special mandate for the state-affairs
    Hath hither brought.
DUKE OF VENICE Senator
    We are very sorry for't.
DUKE OF VENICE
    [To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?
BRABANTIO
    Nothing, but this is so.
OTHELLO
    Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
    What conjuration and what mighty magic,
    For such proceeding I am charged withal,
    I won his daughter.
BRABANTIO
    A maiden never bold;
    Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
    Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
    Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
    It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
    That will confess perfection so could err
    Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
    To find out practises of cunning hell,
    Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
    He wrought upon her.
DUKE OF VENICE
    To vouch this, is no proof,
    Without more wider and more overt test
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
First Senator
    But, Othello, speak:
    Did you by indirect and forced courses
    Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
    Or came it by request and such fair question
    As soul to soul affordeth?
OTHELLO
    I do beseech you,
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
    And let her speak of me before her father:
    If you do find me foul in her report,
    The trust, the office I do hold of you,
    Not only take away, but let your sentence
    Even fall upon my life.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Fetch Desdemona hither.
OTHELLO
    Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
    Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
    And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
    I do confess the vices of my blood,
    So justly to your grave ears I'll present
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
    And she in mine.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Say it, Othello.
OTHELLO
    Her father loved me; oft invited me;
    Still question'd me the story of my life,
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have passed.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field
    Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history:
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline:
    But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively: I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears,
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
    She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story.
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used:
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
    Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants
DUKE OF VENICE
    I think this tale would win my daughter too.
    Good Brabantio,
    Take up this mangled matter at the best:
    Men do their broken weapons rather use
    Than their bare hands.
BRABANTIO
    I pray you, hear her speak:
    If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
    Do you perceive in all this noble company
    Where most you owe obedience?
DESDEMONA
    My noble father,
    I do perceive here a divided duty:
    To you I am bound for life and education;
    My life and education both do learn me
    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
    I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
    And so much duty as my mother show'd
    To you, preferring you before her father,
    So much I challenge that I may profess
    Due to the Moor my lord.
BRABANTIO
    God be wi' you! I have done.
    Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
    Come hither, Moor:
    I here do give thee that with all my heart
    Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
    I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
    I am glad at soul I have no other child:
    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
    Into your favour.
    When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
    To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
    What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
    Patience her injury a mockery makes.
    The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
BRABANTIO
    So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
    We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
    He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
    These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
    But words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
DUKE OF VENICE
    The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
    Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
    known to you; and though we have there a substitute
    of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
    sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
    voice on you: you must therefore be content to
    slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
    more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
OTHELLO
    The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
    A natural and prompt alacrity
    I find in hardness, and do undertake
    These present wars against the Ottomites.
    Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife.
    Due reference of place and exhibition,
    With such accommodation and besort
    As levels with her breeding.
DUKE OF VENICE
    If you please,
    Be't at her father's.
BRABANTIO
    I'll not have it so.
OTHELLO
    Nor I.
DESDEMONA
    Nor I; I would not there reside,
    To put my father in impatient thoughts
    By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
    And let me find a charter in your voice,
    To assist my simpleness.
DUKE OF VENICE
    What would You, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA
    That I did love the Moor to live with him,
    My downright violence and storm of fortunes
    May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
    Even to the very quality of my lord:
    I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
    And to his honour and his valiant parts
    Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
    So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
    And I a heavy interim shall support
    By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
OTHELLO
    Let her have your voices.
    Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
    To please the palate of my appetite,
    Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
    In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
    But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
    And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
    I will your serious and great business scant
    For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
    Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
    My speculative and officed instruments,
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation!
DUKE OF VENICE
    Be it as you shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
    And speed must answer it.
First Senator
    You must away to-night.
OTHELLO
    With all my heart.
DUKE OF VENICE
    At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
    Othello, leave some officer behind,
    And he shall our commission bring to you;
    With such things else of quality and respect
    As doth import you.
OTHELLO
    So please your grace, my ancient;
    A man he is of honest and trust:
    To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needful your good grace shall think
    To be sent after me.
DUKE OF VENICE
    Let it be so.
    Good night to every one.
    To BRABANTIO
    And, noble signior,
    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
First Senator
    Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
BRABANTIO
    Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.
    Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, & c
OTHELLO
    My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
    My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
    I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
    And bring them after in the best advantage.
    Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
    To spend with thee: we must obey the time.
    Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
RODERIGO
    Iago,--
IAGO
    What say'st thou, noble heart?
RODERIGO
    What will I do, thinkest thou?
IAGO
    Why, go to bed, and sleep.
RODERIGO
    I will incontinently drown myself.
IAGO
    If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
    thou silly gentleman!
RODERIGO
    It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
    then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
IAGO
    O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
    times seven years; and since I could distinguish
    betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
    that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
    would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
    would change my humanity with a baboon.
RODERIGO
    What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
    fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
IAGO
    Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
    or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
    our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
    nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
    thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
    distract it with many, either to have it sterile
    with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
    power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
    wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
    scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
    blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
    to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
    reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
    stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
    you call love to be a sect or scion.
RODERIGO
    It cannot be.
IAGO
    It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
    the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
    cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
    friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
    cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
    better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
    purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
    an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
    cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
    love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
    his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
    shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
    money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
    their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
    that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
    to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
    change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
    she will find the error of her choice: she must
    have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
    purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
    more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
    thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
    an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
    too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
    shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
    drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
    thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
    to be drowned and go without her.
RODERIGO
    Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
    the issue?
IAGO
    Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
    thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
    hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
    less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
    against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
    thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
    events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
    Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
    of this to-morrow. Adieu.
RODERIGO
    Where shall we meet i' the morning?
IAGO
    At my lodging.
RODERIGO
    I'll be with thee betimes.
IAGO
    Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
RODERIGO
    What say you?
IAGO
    No more of drowning, do you hear?
RODERIGO
    I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.
    Exit
IAGO
    Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
    For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
    If I would time expend with such a snipe.
    But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
    And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
    He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
    But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
    Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
    The better shall my purpose work on him.
    Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
    To get his place and to plume up my will
    In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
    After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
    That he is too familiar with his wife.
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be suspected, framed to make women false.
    The Moor is of a free and open nature,
    That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose
    As asses are.
    I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
    Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
    Exit
ACT II
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
    Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen 
MONTANO
    What from the cape can you discern at sea?
First Gentleman
    Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
    Descry a sail.
MONTANO
    Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
    A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
    If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
    What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
    Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
Second Gentleman
    A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
    For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
    seems to cast water on the burning bear,
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
    I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.
MONTANO
    If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
    It is impossible they bear it out.
    Enter a third Gentleman
Third Gentleman
    News, lads! our wars are done.
    The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
    That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
    Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
    On most part of their fleet.
MONTANO
    How! is this true?
Third Gentleman
    The ship is here put in,
    A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
    Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
MONTANO
    I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
Third Gentleman
    But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
    With foul and violent tempest.
MONTANO
    Pray heavens he be;
    For I have served him, and the man commands
    Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
    As well to see the vessel that's come in
    As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
    An indistinct regard.
Third Gentleman
    Come, let's do so:
    For every minute is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.
    Enter CASSIO
CASSIO
    Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
    That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
    Give him defence against the elements,
    For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.
MONTANO
    Is he well shipp'd?
CASSIO
    His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cure.
    A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'
    Enter a fourth Gentleman
CASSIO
    What noise?
Fourth Gentleman
    The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
    Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'
CASSIO
    My hopes do shape him for the governor.
    Guns heard
Second Gentlemen
    They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
    Our friends at least.
CASSIO
    I pray you, sir, go forth,
    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
Second Gentleman
    I shall.
    Exit
MONTANO
    But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
CASSIO
    Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame;
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
    Re-enter second Gentleman
    How now! who has put in?
Second Gentleman
    'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
CASSIO
    Has had most favourable and happy speed:
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
    The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
    As having sense of beauty, do omit
    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
    The divine Desdemona.
MONTANO
    What is she?
CASSIO
    She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
    And bring all Cyprus comfort!
    Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants
    O, behold,
    The riches of the ship is come on shore!
    Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
    Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee round!
DESDEMONA
    I thank you, valiant Cassio.
    What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
CASSIO
    He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
    But that he's well and will be shortly here.
DESDEMONA
    O, but I fear--How lost you company?
CASSIO
    The great contention of the sea and skies
    Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.
    Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard
Second Gentleman
    They give their greeting to the citadel;
    This likewise is a friend.
CASSIO
    See for the news.
    Exit Gentleman
    Good ancient, you are welcome.
    To EMILIA
    Welcome, mistress.
    Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
    Kissing her
IAGO
    Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
    You'll have enough.
DESDEMONA
    Alas, she has no speech.
IAGO
    In faith, too much;
    I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
    Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
    She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
    And chides with thinking.
EMILIA
    You have little cause to say so.
IAGO
    Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
    Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
    Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
    Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.
DESDEMONA
    O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
IAGO
    Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
    You rise to play and go to bed to work.
EMILIA
    You shall not write my praise.
IAGO
    No, let me not.
DESDEMONA
    What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
    praise me?
IAGO
    O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
    For I am nothing, if not critical.
DESDEMONA
    Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
IAGO
    Ay, madam.
DESDEMONA
    I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
    Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
IAGO
    I am about it; but indeed my invention
    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
    It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
    And thus she is deliver'd.
    If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
    The one's for use, the other useth it.
DESDEMONA
    Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
IAGO
    If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
DESDEMONA
    Worse and worse.
EMILIA
    How if fair and foolish?
IAGO
    She never yet was foolish that was fair;
    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
DESDEMONA
    These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
    the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
    her that's foul and foolish?
IAGO
    There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
DESDEMONA
    O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
    But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
    woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
    merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
IAGO
    She that was ever fair and never proud,
    Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
    Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
    She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
    She that in wisdom never was so frail
    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
    She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
    See suitors following and not look behind,
    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
DESDEMONA
    To do what?
IAGO
    To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
DESDEMONA
    O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
    of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
    you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
    counsellor?
CASSIO
    He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
    the soldier than in the scholar.
IAGO
    [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
    whisper: with as little a web as this will I
    ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
    her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
    You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
    these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
    been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
    oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
    sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
    courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
    to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
    Trumpet within
    The Moor! I know his trumpet.
CASSIO
    'Tis truly so.
DESDEMONA
    Let's meet him and receive him.
CASSIO
    Lo, where he comes!
    Enter OTHELLO and Attendants
OTHELLO
    O my fair warrior!
DESDEMONA
    My dear Othello!
OTHELLO
    It gives me wonder great as my content
    To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
    If after every tempest come such calms,
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
    And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
    Olympus-high and duck again as low
    As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
    'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
    My soul hath her content so absolute
    That not another comfort like to this
    Succeeds in unknown fate.
DESDEMONA
    The heavens forbid
    But that our loves and comforts should increase,
    Even as our days do grow!
OTHELLO
    Amen to that, sweet powers!
    I cannot speak enough of this content;
    It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
    And this, and this, the greatest discords be
    Kissing her
    That e'er our hearts shall make!
IAGO
    [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
    But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
    As honest as I am.
OTHELLO
    Come, let us to the castle.
    News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
    are drown'd.
    How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
    Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
    I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
    I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
    In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
    Bring thou the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
    Once more, well met at Cyprus.
    Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
IAGO
    Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
    hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
    men being in love have then a nobility in their
    natures more than is native to them--list me. The
    lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
    guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
    directly in love with him.
RODERIGO
    With him! why, 'tis not possible.
IAGO
    Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
    Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
    but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
    and will she love him still for prating? let not
    thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
    and what delight shall she have to look on the
    devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
    sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
    give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
    sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
    the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
    required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
    find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
    disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
    instruct her in it and compel her to some second
    choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
    pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
    eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
    does? a knave very voluble; no further
    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
    civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
    of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
    none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
    finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
    counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
    present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
    knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
    requisites in him that folly and green minds look
    after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
    hath found him already.
RODERIGO
    I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
    most blessed condition.
IAGO
    Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
    grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
    have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
    not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
    not mark that?
RODERIGO
    Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
IAGO
    Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
    to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
    so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
    together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
    mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
    the master and main exercise, the incorporate
    conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
    have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
    for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
    you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
    some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
    too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
    other course you please, which the time shall more
    favourably minister.
RODERIGO
    Well.
IAGO
    Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
    may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
    even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
    mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
    taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
    shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
    the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
    impediment most profitably removed, without the
    which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
RODERIGO
    I will do this, if I can bring it to any
    opportunity.
IAGO
    I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
    I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
RODERIGO
    Adieu.
    Exit
IAGO
    That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
    The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
    Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
    A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
    I stand accountant for as great a sin,
    But partly led to diet my revenge,
    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
    Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
    And nothing can or shall content my soul
    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
    Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
    At least into a jealousy so strong
    That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
    For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
    Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
    For making him egregiously an ass
    And practising upon his peace and quiet
    Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
    Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.
    Exit
SCENE II. A street.
    Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following 
Herald
    It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
    general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
    importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
    every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
    some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
    revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
    nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
    proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
    liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
    till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
    isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
    Exeunt
SCENE III. A hall in the castle.
    Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants 
OTHELLO
    Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
    Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
    Not to outsport discretion.
CASSIO
    Iago hath direction what to do;
    But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
    Will I look to't.
OTHELLO
    Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
    Let me have speech with you.
    To DESDEMONA
    Come, my dear love,
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
    Good night.
    Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
    Enter IAGO
CASSIO
    Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
IAGO
    Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
    clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
    of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
    he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
    she is sport for Jove.
CASSIO
    She's a most exquisite lady.
IAGO
    And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.
CASSIO
    Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
IAGO
    What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
    provocation.
CASSIO
    An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
IAGO
    And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
CASSIO
    She is indeed perfection.
IAGO
    Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
    have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
    of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
    the health of black Othello.
CASSIO
    Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
    unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
    courtesy would invent some other custom of
    entertainment.
IAGO
    O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
    you.
CASSIO
    I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
    craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
    it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
    and dare not task my weakness with any more.
IAGO
    What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
    desire it.
CASSIO
    Where are they?
IAGO
    Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
CASSIO
    I'll do't; but it dislikes me.
    Exit
IAGO
    If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
    As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honours in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
    Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine
CASSIO
    'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
MONTANO
    Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
    a soldier.
IAGO
    Some wine, ho!
    Sings
    And let me the canakin clink, clink;
    And let me the canakin clink
    A soldier's a man;
    A life's but a span;
    Why, then, let a soldier drink.
    Some wine, boys!
CASSIO
    'Fore God, an excellent song.
IAGO
    I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
    most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
    your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
    to your English.
CASSIO
    Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
IAGO
    Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
    drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
    gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
    can be filled.
CASSIO
    To the health of our general!
MONTANO
    I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.
IAGO
    O sweet England!
    King Stephen was a worthy peer,
    His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear,
    With that he call'd the tailor lown.
    He was a wight of high renown,
    And thou art but of low degree:
    'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
    Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
    Some wine, ho!
CASSIO
    Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
IAGO
    Will you hear't again?
CASSIO
    No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
    does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
    be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
IAGO
    It's true, good lieutenant.
CASSIO
    For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
    any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.
IAGO
    And so do I too, lieutenant.
CASSIO
    Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
    lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
    have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
    us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
    Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
    ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
    I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
    speak well enough.
All
    Excellent well.
CASSIO
    Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.
    Exit
MONTANO
    To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
IAGO
    You see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
    And give direction: and do but see his vice;
    'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
    The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
    I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
    On some odd time of his infirmity,
    Will shake this island.
MONTANO
    But is he often thus?
IAGO
    'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
    He'll watch the horologe a double set,
    If drink rock not his cradle.
MONTANO
    It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
    And looks not on his evils: is not this true?
    Enter RODERIGO
IAGO
    [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
    I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
    Exit RODERIGO
MONTANO
    And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
    Should hazard such a place as his own second
    With one of an ingraft infirmity:
    It were an honest action to say
    So to the Moor.
IAGO
    Not I, for this fair island:
    I do love Cassio well; and would do much
    To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?
    Cry within: 'Help! help!'
    Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO
CASSIO
    You rogue! you rascal!
MONTANO
    What's the matter, lieutenant?
CASSIO
    A knave teach me my duty!
    I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
RODERIGO
    Beat me!
CASSIO
    Dost thou prate, rogue?
    Striking RODERIGO
MONTANO
    Nay, good lieutenant;
    Staying him
    I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
CASSIO
    Let me go, sir,
    Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
MONTANO
    Come, come,
    you're drunk.
CASSIO
    Drunk!
    They fight
IAGO
    [Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
    Exit RODERIGO
    Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
    Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;
    Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
    Bell rings
    Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed for ever.
    Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants
OTHELLO
    What is the matter here?
MONTANO
    'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
    Faints
OTHELLO
    Hold, for your lives!
IAGO
    Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
    Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
    Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!
OTHELLO
    Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
    Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
    For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
    He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
    Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
    From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
    Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
    Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.
IAGO
    I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
    In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
    As if some planet had unwitted men--
    Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
    In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;
    And would in action glorious I had lost
    Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
OTHELLO
    How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
CASSIO
    I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
OTHELLO
    Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
    The gravity and stillness of your youth
    The world hath noted, and your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
    That you unlace your reputation thus
    And spend your rich opinion for the name
    Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.
MONTANO
    Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
    Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
    While I spare speech, which something now
    offends me,--
    Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
    By me that's said or done amiss this night;
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
    And to defend ourselves it be a sin
    When violence assails us.
OTHELLO
    Now, by heaven,
    My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
    And passion, having my best judgment collied,
    Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
    Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
    Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
    How this foul rout began, who set it on;
    And he that is approved in this offence,
    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
    To manage private and domestic quarrel,
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
    'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
MONTANOACT I
SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
    Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending 
DUKE ORSINO
    If music be the food of love, play on;
    Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
    The appetite may sicken, and so die.
    That strain again! it had a dying fall:
    O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
    That breathes upon a bank of violets,
    Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
    'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
    O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
    That, notwithstanding thy capacity
    Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
    Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
    But falls into abatement and low price,
    Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
    That it alone is high fantastical.
CURIO
    Will you go hunt, my lord?
DUKE ORSINO
    What, Curio?
CURIO
    The hart.
DUKE ORSINO
    Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
    O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
    Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
    That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
    And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
    E'er since pursue me.
    Enter VALENTINE
    How now! what news from her?
VALENTINE
    So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
    But from her handmaid do return this answer:
    The element itself, till seven years' heat,
    Shall not behold her face at ample view;
    But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
    And water once a day her chamber round
    With eye-offending brine: all this to season
    A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
    And lasting in her sad remembrance.
DUKE ORSINO
    O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
    To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
    How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
    Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
    That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
    These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
    Her sweet perfections with one self king!
    Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
    Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. The sea-coast.
    Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors 
VIOLA
    What country, friends, is this?
Captain
    This is Illyria, lady.
VIOLA
    And what should I do in Illyria?
    My brother he is in Elysium.
    Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
Captain
    It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
VIOLA
    O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
Captain
    True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
    Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
    When you and those poor number saved with you
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
    Most provident in peril, bind himself,
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
    To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
    Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
    I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
    So long as I could see.
VIOLA
    For saying so, there's gold:
    Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
    Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
    The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
Captain
    Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
    Not three hours' travel from this very place.
VIOLA
    Who governs here?
Captain
    A noble duke, in nature as in name.
VIOLA
    What is the name?
Captain
    Orsino.
VIOLA
    Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
    He was a bachelor then.
Captain
    And so is now, or was so very late;
    For but a month ago I went from hence,
    And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
    What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
    That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
VIOLA
    What's she?
Captain
    A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
    That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
    In the protection of his son, her brother,
    Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
    They say, she hath abjured the company
    And sight of men.
VIOLA
    O that I served that lady
    And might not be delivered to the world,
    Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
    What my estate is!
Captain
    That were hard to compass;
    Because she will admit no kind of suit,
    No, not the duke's.
VIOLA
    There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
    And though that nature with a beauteous wall
    Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
    I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
    With this thy fair and outward character.
    I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
    Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
    For such disguise as haply shall become
    The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
    Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
    It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
    And speak to him in many sorts of music
    That will allow me very worth his service.
    What else may hap to time I will commit;
    Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Captain
    Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
    When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
VIOLA
    I thank thee: lead me on.
    Exeunt
SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.
    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA 
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
    her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
MARIA
    By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
    nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
    exceptions to your ill hours.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Why, let her except, before excepted.
MARIA
    Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
    limits of order.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
    these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
    these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
    themselves in their own straps.
MARIA
    That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
    my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
    knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
MARIA
    Ay, he.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
MARIA
    What's that to the purpose?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
MARIA
    Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
    he's a very fool and a prodigal.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
    viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
    word for word without book, and hath all the good
    gifts of nature.
MARIA
    He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
    he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
    he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
    hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
    he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
    that say so of him. Who are they?
MARIA
    They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
    her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
    drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
    that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
    o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
    Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
    Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW
    Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Sweet Sir Andrew!
SIR ANDREW
    Bless you, fair shrew.
MARIA
    And you too, sir.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
SIR ANDREW
    What's that?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    My niece's chambermaid.
SIR ANDREW
    Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
MARIA
    My name is Mary, sir.
SIR ANDREW
    Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
    her, woo her, assail her.
SIR ANDREW
    By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
    company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
MARIA
    Fare you well, gentlemen.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
    never draw sword again.
SIR ANDREW
    An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
    draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
    fools in hand?
MARIA
    Sir, I have not you by the hand.
SIR ANDREW
    Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
MARIA
    Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
    your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
SIR ANDREW
    Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
MARIA
    It's dry, sir.
SIR ANDREW
    Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
    keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
MARIA
    A dry jest, sir.
SIR ANDREW
    Are you full of them?
MARIA
    Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
    now I let go your hand, I am barren.
    Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
    O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
    see thee so put down?
SIR ANDREW
    Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
    put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
    than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
    great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    No question.
SIR ANDREW
    An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
    to-morrow, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Pourquoi, my dear knight?
SIR ANDREW
    What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
    bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
    fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
    followed the arts!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
SIR ANDREW
    Why, would that have mended my hair?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
SIR ANDREW
    But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
    hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
    and spin it off.
SIR ANDREW
    Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
    will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
    she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
    her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
    have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
    man.
SIR ANDREW
    I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
    strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
    and revels sometimes altogether.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
SIR ANDREW
    As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
    degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
    with an old man.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
SIR ANDREW
    Faith, I can cut a caper.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    And I can cut the mutton to't.
SIR ANDREW
    And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
    as any man in Illyria.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
    these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
    take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
    thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
    a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
    so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
    dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
    I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
    leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
SIR ANDREW
    Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
    flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
SIR ANDREW
    Taurus! That's sides and heart.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
    caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
    Exeunt
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
    Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire 
VALENTINE
    If the duke continue these favours towards you,
    Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
    known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
VIOLA
    You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
    you call in question the continuance of his love:
    is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
VALENTINE
    No, believe me.
VIOLA
    I thank you. Here comes the count.
    Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants
DUKE ORSINO
    Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA
    On your attendance, my lord; here.
DUKE ORSINO
    Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
    Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
    To thee the book even of my secret soul:
    Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
    Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
    And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
    Till thou have audience.
VIOLA
    Sure, my noble lord,
    If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
    As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
DUKE ORSINO
    Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
    Rather than make unprofited return.
VIOLA
    Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE ORSINO
    O, then unfold the passion of my love,
    Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
    It shall become thee well to act my woes;
    She will attend it better in thy youth
    Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
VIOLA
    I think not so, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
    Dear lad, believe it;
    For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
    That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
    Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
    Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
    And all is semblative a woman's part.
    I know thy constellation is right apt
    For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
    All, if you will; for I myself am best
    When least in company. Prosper well in this,
    And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
    To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA
    I'll do my best
    To woo your lady:
    Aside
    yet, a barful strife!
    Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
    Exeunt
SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.
    Enter MARIA and Clown 
MARIA
    Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
    not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
    way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Clown
    Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
    world needs to fear no colours.
MARIA
    Make that good.
Clown
    He shall see none to fear.
MARIA
    A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
    saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
Clown
    Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA
    In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Clown
    Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
    that are fools, let them use their talents.
MARIA
    Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
    to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
Clown
    Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
    for turning away, let summer bear it out.
MARIA
    You are resolute, then?
Clown
    Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
MARIA
    That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
    break, your gaskins fall.
Clown
    Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
    Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
    piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
MARIA
    Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
    lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
    Exit
Clown
    Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
    Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
    prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
    pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
    'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
    Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
    God bless thee, lady!
OLIVIA
    Take the fool away.
Clown
    Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
OLIVIA
    Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
    besides, you grow dishonest.
Clown
    Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
    will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
    the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
    himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
    he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
    that's mended is but patched: virtue that
    transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
    amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
    simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
    what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
    calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
    away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
OLIVIA
    Sir, I bade them take away you.
Clown
    Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
    facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
    motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
    prove you a fool.
OLIVIA
    Can you do it?
Clown
    Dexterously, good madonna.
OLIVIA
    Make your proof.
Clown
    I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
    of virtue, answer me.
OLIVIA
    Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
Clown
    Good madonna, why mournest thou?
OLIVIA
    Good fool, for my brother's death.
Clown
    I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
OLIVIA
    I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
Clown
    The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
    soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
OLIVIA
    What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
MALVOLIO
    Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
    infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
    better fool.
Clown
    God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
    better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
    sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
    word for two pence that you are no fool.
OLIVIA
    How say you to that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
    I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
    barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
    with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
    than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
    already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
    him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
    that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
    than the fools' zanies.
OLIVIA
    Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
    with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
    guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
    things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
    there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
    nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
    man, though he do nothing but reprove.
Clown
    Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
    speakest well of fools!
    Re-enter MARIA
MARIA
    Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
    desires to speak with you.
OLIVIA
    From the Count Orsino, is it?
MARIA
    I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
OLIVIA
    Who of my people hold him in delay?
MARIA
    Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
OLIVIA
    Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
    madman: fie on him!
    Exit MARIA
    Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
    am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
    Exit MALVOLIO
    Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
    people dislike it.
Clown
    Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
    son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
    brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
    most weak pia mater.
    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH
OLIVIA
    By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    A gentleman.
OLIVIA
    A gentleman! what gentleman?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
    pickle-herring! How now, sot!
Clown
    Good Sir Toby!
OLIVIA
    Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
OLIVIA
    Ay, marry, what is he?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
    me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
    Exit
OLIVIA
    What's a drunken man like, fool?
Clown
    Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
    draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
    him; and a third drowns him.
OLIVIA
    Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
    coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
    drowned: go, look after him.
Clown
    He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
    to the madman.
    Exit
    Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
    Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
    you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
    understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
    with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
    have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
    comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
    lady? he's fortified against any denial.
OLIVIA
    Tell him he shall not speak with me.
MALVOLIO
    Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
    door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
    a bench, but he'll speak with you.
OLIVIA
    What kind o' man is he?
MALVOLIO
    Why, of mankind.
OLIVIA
    What manner of man?
MALVOLIO
    Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
OLIVIA
    Of what personage and years is he?
MALVOLIO
    Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
    a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
    cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
    in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
    well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
    would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
OLIVIA
    Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
MALVOLIO
    Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
    Exit
    Re-enter MARIA
OLIVIA
    Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
    We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
    Enter VIOLA, and Attendants
VIOLA
    The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
OLIVIA
    Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
    Your will?
VIOLA
    Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
    pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
    for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
    my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
    penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
    beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
    comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
OLIVIA
    Whence came you, sir?
VIOLA
    I can say little more than I have studied, and that
    question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
    modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
    that I may proceed in my speech.
OLIVIA
    Are you a comedian?
VIOLA
    No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
    of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
    the lady of the house?
OLIVIA
    If I do not usurp myself, I am.
VIOLA
    Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
    yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
    to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
    on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
    the heart of my message.
OLIVIA
    Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
VIOLA
    Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
OLIVIA
    It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
    keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
    and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
    than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
    you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
    moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
MARIA
    Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
VIOLA
    No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
    longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
    lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
OLIVIA
    Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
    the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
VIOLA
    It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
    war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
    hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
OLIVIA
    Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
VIOLA
    The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
    learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
    would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
    divinity, to any other's, profanation.
OLIVIA
    Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
    Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
    Now, sir, what is your text?
VIOLA
    Most sweet lady,--
OLIVIA
    A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
    Where lies your text?
VIOLA
    In Orsino's bosom.
OLIVIA
    In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
VIOLA
    To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
OLIVIA
    O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
VIOLA
    Good madam, let me see your face.
OLIVIA
    Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
    with my face? You are now out of your text: but
    we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
    Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
    not well done?
    Unveiling
VIOLA
    Excellently done, if God did all.
OLIVIA
    'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
VIOLA
    'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
    Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
    Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
    If you will lead these graces to the grave
    And leave the world no copy.
OLIVIA
    O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
    out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
    inventoried, and every particle and utensil
    labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
    indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
    them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
    you sent hither to praise me?
VIOLA
    I see you what you are, you are too proud;
    But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
    My lord and master loves you: O, such love
    Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
    The nonpareil of beauty!
OLIVIA
    How does he love me?
VIOLA
    With adorations, fertile tears,
    With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
OLIVIA
    Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
    Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
    Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
    In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
    And in dimension and the shape of nature
    A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
    He might have took his answer long ago.
VIOLA
    If I did love you in my master's flame,
    With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
    In your denial I would find no sense;
    I would not understand it.
OLIVIA
    Why, what would you?
VIOLA
    Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
    And call upon my soul within the house;
    Write loyal cantons of contemned love
    And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
    Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
    And make the babbling gossip of the air
    Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
    Between the elements of air and earth,
    But you should pity me!
OLIVIA
    You might do much.
    What is your parentage?
VIOLA
    Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
    I am a gentleman.
OLIVIA
    Get you to your lord;
    I cannot love him: let him send no more;
    Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
    To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
    I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
VIOLA
    I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
    My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
    Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
    And let your fervor, like my master's, be
    Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
    Exit
OLIVIA
    'What is your parentage?'
    'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
    I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
    Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
    Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
    soft, soft!
    Unless the master were the man. How now!
    Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
    Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
    With an invisible and subtle stealth
    To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
    What ho, Malvolio!
    Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
    Here, madam, at your service.
OLIVIA
    Run after that same peevish messenger,
    The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
    Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
    Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
    Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
    If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
    I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
MALVOLIO
    Madam, I will.
    Exit
OLIVIA
    I do I know not what, and fear to find
    Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
    Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
    What is decreed must be, and be this so.
    Exit
ACT II
SCENE I. The sea-coast.
    Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN 
ANTONIO
    Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
SEBASTIAN
    By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
    me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
    distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
    leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
    recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
    ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
SEBASTIAN
    No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
    extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
    touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
    what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
    me in manners the rather to express myself. You
    must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
    which I called Roderigo. My father was that
    Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
    of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
    born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
    would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
    for some hour before you took me from the breach of
    the sea was my sister drowned.
ANTONIO
    Alas the day!
SEBASTIAN
    A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
    me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
    though I could not with such estimable wonder
    overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
    publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
    call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
    water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
ANTONIO
    Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
SEBASTIAN
    O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
ANTONIO
    If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
    your servant.
SEBASTIAN
    If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
    kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
    Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
    and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
    upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
    tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
    Exit
ANTONIO
    The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
    I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
    Else would I very shortly see thee there.
    But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
    That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
    Exit
SCENE II. A street.
    Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following 
MALVOLIO
    Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
VIOLA
    Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
    arrived but hither.
MALVOLIO
    She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
    saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
    She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
    into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
    and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
    come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
    your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
VIOLA
    She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
MALVOLIO
    Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
    will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
    stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
    it his that finds it.
    Exit
VIOLA
    I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
    Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
    She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
    That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
    For she did speak in starts distractedly.
    She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
    Invites me in this churlish messenger.
    None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
    I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
    Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
    Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
    How easy is it for the proper-false
    In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
    Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
    For such as we are made of, such we be.
    How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
    And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
    And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
    What will become of this? As I am man,
    My state is desperate for my master's love;
    As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
    O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
    It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
    Exit
SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.
    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW 
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
    midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
    surgere,' thou know'st,--
SIR ANDREW
    Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
    late is to be up late.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
    To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
    early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
    to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
    four elements?
SIR ANDREW
    Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
    of eating and drinking.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
    Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
    Enter Clown
SIR ANDREW
    Here comes the fool, i' faith.
Clown
    How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
    of 'we three'?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
SIR ANDREW
    By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
    had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
    and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
    sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
    night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
    Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
    very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
    leman: hadst it?
Clown
    I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
    is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
    Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
SIR ANDREW
    Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
    is done. Now, a song.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
SIR ANDREW
    There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
Clown
    Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    A love-song, a love-song.
SIR ANDREW
    Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
Clown
    [Sings]
    O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
    O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
    That can sing both high and low:
    Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
    Journeys end in lovers meeting,
    Every wise man's son doth know.
SIR ANDREW
    Excellent good, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Good, good.
Clown
    [Sings]
    What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
    Present mirth hath present laughter;
    What's to come is still unsure:
    In delay there lies no plenty;
    Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
    Youth's a stuff will not endure.
SIR ANDREW
    A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    A contagious breath.
SIR ANDREW
    Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
    But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
    rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
    souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
SIR ANDREW
    An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
Clown
    By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
SIR ANDREW
    Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
Clown
    'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
    constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
SIR ANDREW
    'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
    call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
Clown
    I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
SIR ANDREW
    Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
    Catch sung
    Enter MARIA
MARIA
    What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
    have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
    turn you out of doors, never trust me.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
    a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
    I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
    Tillyvally. Lady!
    Sings
    'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
Clown
    Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
SIR ANDREW
    Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
    I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
    more natural.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    [Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
MARIA
    For the love o' God, peace!
    Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
    My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
    no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
    tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
    alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
    coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
    of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
    time in you?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
MALVOLIO
    Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
    tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
    kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
    you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
    are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
    you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
    you farewell.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
MARIA
    Nay, good Sir Toby.
Clown
    'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
MALVOLIO
    Is't even so?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    'But I will never die.'
Clown
    Sir Toby, there you lie.
MALVOLIO
    This is much credit to you.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    'Shall I bid him go?'
Clown
    'What an if you do?'
SIR TOBY BELCH
    'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
Clown
    'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
    steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
    virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
Clown
    Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
    mouth too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
    crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
MALVOLIO
    Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
    thing more than contempt, you would not give means
    for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
    Exit
MARIA
    Go shake your ears.
SIR ANDREW
    'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
    a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
    break promise with him and make a fool of him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
    deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
MARIA
    Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
    youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
    much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
    alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
    nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
    think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
    I know I can do it.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
MARIA
    Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
SIR ANDREW
    O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
    dear knight?
SIR ANDREW
    I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
    good enough.
MARIA
    The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
    constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
    that cons state without book and utters it by great
    swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
    crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
    his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
    him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
    notable cause to work.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What wilt thou do?
MARIA
    I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
    love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
    of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
    of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
    himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
    like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
    can hardly make distinction of our hands.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Excellent! I smell a device.
SIR ANDREW
    I have't in my nose too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
    that they come from my niece, and that she's in
    love with him.
MARIA
    My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
SIR ANDREW
    And your horse now would make him an ass.
MARIA
    Ass, I doubt not.
SIR ANDREW
    O, 'twill be admirable!
MARIA
    Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
    work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
    fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
    observe his construction of it. For this night, to
    bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
    Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Good night, Penthesilea.
SIR ANDREW
    Before me, she's a good wench.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
    what o' that?
SIR ANDREW
    I was adored once too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
    more money.
SIR ANDREW
    If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
    the end, call me cut.
SIR ANDREW
    If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
    to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
    Exeunt
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
    Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others 
DUKE ORSINO
    Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
    Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
    That old and antique song we heard last night:
    Methought it did relieve my passion much,
    More than light airs and recollected terms
    Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
    Come, but one verse.
CURIO
    He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
DUKE ORSINO
    Who was it?
CURIO
    Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
    Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
DUKE ORSINO
    Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
    Exit CURIO. Music plays
    Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
    In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
    For such as I am all true lovers are,
    Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
    Save in the constant image of the creature
    That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
VIOLA
    It gives a very echo to the seat
    Where Love is throned.
DUKE ORSINO
    Thou dost speak masterly:
    My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
    Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
    Hath it not, boy?
VIOLA
    A little, by your favour.
DUKE ORSINO
    What kind of woman is't?
VIOLA
    Of your complexion.
DUKE ORSINO
    She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
VIOLA
    About your years, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
    Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
    An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
    So sways she level in her husband's heart:
    For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
    Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
    More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
    Than women's are.
VIOLA
    I think it well, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
    Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
    Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
    For women are as roses, whose fair flower
    Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
VIOLA
    And so they are: alas, that they are so;
    To die, even when they to perfection grow!
    Re-enter CURIO and Clown
DUKE ORSINO
    O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
    Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
    The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
    And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
    Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
    And dallies with the innocence of love,
    Like the old age.
Clown
    Are you ready, sir?
DUKE ORSINO
    Ay; prithee, sing.
    Music
    SONG.
Clown
    Come away, come away, death,
    And in sad cypress let me be laid;
    Fly away, fly away breath;
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
    O, prepare it!
    My part of death, no one so true
    Did share it.
    Not a flower, not a flower sweet
    On my black coffin let there be strown;
    Not a friend, not a friend greet
    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
    A thousand thousand sighs to save,
    Lay me, O, where
    Sad true lover never find my grave,
    To weep there!
DUKE ORSINO
    There's for thy pains.
Clown
    No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
DUKE ORSINO
    I'll pay thy pleasure then.
Clown
    Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
DUKE ORSINO
    Give me now leave to leave thee.
Clown
    Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
    tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
    thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
    constancy put to sea, that their business might be
    every thing and their intent every where; for that's
    it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
    Exit
DUKE ORSINO
    Let all the rest give place.
    CURIO and Attendants retire
    Once more, Cesario,
    Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
    Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
    Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
    The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
    Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
    But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
    That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
VIOLA
    But if she cannot love you, sir?
DUKE ORSINO
    I cannot be so answer'd.
VIOLA
    Sooth, but you must.
    Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
    Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
    As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
    You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
DUKE ORSINO
    There is no woman's sides
    Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
    As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
    So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
    Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
    No motion of the liver, but the palate,
    That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
    But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
    And can digest as much: make no compare
    Between that love a woman can bear me
    And that I owe Olivia.
VIOLA
    Ay, but I know--
DUKE ORSINO
    What dost thou know?
VIOLA
    Too well what love women to men may owe:
    In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
    My father had a daughter loved a man,
    As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
    I should your lordship.
DUKE ORSINO
    And what's her history?
VIOLA
    A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
    But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
    Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
    And with a green and yellow melancholy
    She sat like patience on a monument,
    Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
    We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
    Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
    Much in our vows, but little in our love.
DUKE ORSINO
    But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
VIOLA
    I am all the daughters of my father's house,
    And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
    Sir, shall I to this lady?
DUKE ORSINO
    Ay, that's the theme.
    To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
    My love can give no place, bide no denay.
    Exeunt
SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.
    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN 
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
FABIAN
    Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
    let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
    rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
FABIAN
    I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
    favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
    fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
SIR ANDREW
    An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Here comes the little villain.
    Enter MARIA
    How now, my metal of India!
MARIA
    Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
    coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
    sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
    hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
    know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
    him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
    Throws down a letter
    for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
    Exit
    Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
    'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
    me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
    thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
    of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
    exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
    What should I think on't?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Here's an overweening rogue!
FABIAN
    O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
    of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
SIR ANDREW
    'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Peace, I say.
MALVOLIO
    To be Count Malvolio!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Ah, rogue!
SIR ANDREW
    Pistol him, pistol him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Peace, peace!
MALVOLIO
    There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
    married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
SIR ANDREW
    Fie on him, Jezebel!
FABIAN
    O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
    imagination blows him.
MALVOLIO
    Having been three months married to her, sitting in
    my state,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
MALVOLIO
    Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
    gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
    Olivia sleeping,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Fire and brimstone!
FABIAN
    O, peace, peace!
MALVOLIO
    And then to have the humour of state; and after a
    demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
    place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
    kinsman Toby,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Bolts and shackles!
FABIAN
    O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
MALVOLIO
    Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
    out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
    up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
    approaches; courtesies there to me,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Shall this fellow live?
FABIAN
    Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
MALVOLIO
    I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
    smile with an austere regard of control,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
MALVOLIO
    Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
    your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    What, what?
MALVOLIO
    'You must amend your drunkenness.'
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Out, scab!
FABIAN
    Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
MALVOLIO
    'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
    a foolish knight,'--
SIR ANDREW
    That's me, I warrant you.
MALVOLIO
    'One Sir Andrew,'--
SIR ANDREW
    I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
MALVOLIO
    What employment have we here?
    Taking up the letter
FABIAN
    Now is the woodcock near the gin.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
    aloud to him!
MALVOLIO
    By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
    very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
    great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
SIR ANDREW
    Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
MALVOLIO
    [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
    wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
    Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
    uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
FABIAN
    This wins him, liver and all.
MALVOLIO
    [Reads]
    Jove knows I love: But who?
    Lips, do not move;
    No man must know.
    'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
    altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
    thee, Malvolio?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Marry, hang thee, brock!
MALVOLIO
    [Reads]
    I may command where I adore;
    But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
    With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
    M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
FABIAN
    A fustian riddle!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Excellent wench, say I.
MALVOLIO
    'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
    me see, let me see, let me see.
FABIAN
    What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
SIR TOBY BELCH
    And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
MALVOLIO
    'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
    me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
    evident to any formal capacity; there is no
    obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
    that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
    that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
    I,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
    O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
FABIAN
    Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
    rank as a fox.
MALVOLIO
    M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
FABIAN
    Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
    excellent at faults.
MALVOLIO
    M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
    that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
FABIAN
    And O shall end, I hope.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
MALVOLIO
    And then I comes behind.
FABIAN
    Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
    more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
    you.
MALVOLIO
    M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
    yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
    every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
    here follows prose.
    Reads
    'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
    am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
    are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
    have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
    their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
    and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
    cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
    opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
    thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
    the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
    that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
    yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
    cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
    made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
    thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
    not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
    She that would alter services with thee,
    THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
    Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
    open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
    I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
    acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
    I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
    me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
    loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
    late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
    and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
    with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
    of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
    be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
    cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
    on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
    postscript.
    Reads
    'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
    entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
    thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
    presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
    Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
    everything that thou wilt have me.

FABIAN
    I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
    of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    I could marry this wench for this device.
SIR ANDREW
    So could I too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
SIR ANDREW
    Nor I neither.
FABIAN
    Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
    Re-enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
SIR ANDREW
    Or o' mine either?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
    bond-slave?
SIR ANDREW
    I' faith, or I either?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
    the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
MARIA
    Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
MARIA
    If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
    his first approach before my lady: he will come to
    her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
    abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
    and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
    unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
    melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
    into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
    me.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
SIR ANDREW
    I'll make one too.

ACT III
SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.
    Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour 
VIOLA
    Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
    thy tabour?
Clown
    No, sir, I live by the church.
VIOLA
    Art thou a churchman?
Clown
    No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
    I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
    the church.
VIOLA
    So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
    beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
    tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
Clown
    You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
    but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
    wrong side may be turned outward!
VIOLA
    Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
    words may quickly make them wanton.
Clown
    I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
VIOLA
    Why, man?
Clown
    Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
    word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
    are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
VIOLA
    Thy reason, man?
Clown
    Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
    words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
    reason with them.
VIOLA
    I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Clown
    Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
    conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
    to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
VIOLA
    Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
Clown
    No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
    will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
    fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
    herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
    her fool, but her corrupter of words.
VIOLA
    I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
Clown
    Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
    it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
    the fool should be as oft with your master as with
    my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
VIOLA
    Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
    Hold, there's expenses for thee.
Clown
    Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
VIOLA
    By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
    one;
    Aside
    though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
    lady within?
Clown
    Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
VIOLA
    Yes, being kept together and put to use.
Clown
    I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
    a Cressida to this Troilus.
VIOLA
    I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
Clown
    The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
    a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
    within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
    come; who you are and what you would are out of my
    welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
    Exit
VIOLA
    This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
    And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
    He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
    The quality of persons, and the time,
    And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
    That comes before his eye. This is a practise
    As full of labour as a wise man's art
    For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
    But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Save you, gentleman.
VIOLA
    And you, sir.
SIR ANDREW
    Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
VIOLA
    Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
SIR ANDREW
    I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
SIR TOBY BELCH
    Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
    you should enter, if your trade be to her.
VIOLA
    I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
    list of my voyage.
    If partially affined, or leagued in office,
    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
    Thou art no soldier.
IAGO
    Touch me not so near:
    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
    Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
    Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
    Montano and myself being in speech,
    There comes a fellow crying out for help:
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,
    To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
    Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
    Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
    The town might fall in fright: he, swift
